The bandwidth is 200 Hz - 40 Hz = 160 Hz.
A minimum sampling rate of 320 Hz is needed to capture all information in the signal.
The ones between 40 Hz and 160 Hz will be recorded correctly.
The ones between 160 Hz and 200 Hz will appear as 0 Hz to 40 Hz due to aliasing.
Since we know there are no real frequencies below 40 Hz, we can shift them back up to 160 Hz - 200 Hz to recover the signal.
This only works if the input signal is correctly filtered to have no real frequencies or noise below 40 Hz.
Else, sampling at 400 Hz is needed.

I can't really tell them apart by looking at the spectrogram generated by my code.
Some don't seem to appear at all.
I can see them on plt.specgram and they do look different there, so I must be doing something wrong (window size / overlap too small?).

Signal = 90 dB
SNR = 80 dB
80 dB = 90 dB - Noise
Noise = 10 dB
